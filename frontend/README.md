## UX Guidelines

- Use Angular Material 20 (Material 3 theming) for all UI components.
- Use TailwindCSS 3.4+ for layout and spacing utilities.
- Color palette: primary indigo-600, secondary violet-500, background slate-50, surface white.
- Typography: Inter font; body text 16px, headings 20–32px.
- Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 px increments.
- Components must be responsive: single-column on mobile, multi-column on larger screens.
- Use `<a mat-flat-button>` for navigation links and `<button mat-flat-button>` for actions.
- Apply subtle animations (150–200ms) in line with Material motion guidelines.
- Ensure accessibility: WCAG AA contrast, proper aria-labels, and visible focus states.
